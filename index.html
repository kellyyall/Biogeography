            <h2 class="title">Fire Events Around 1850s</h2>
            <li>In the 1820s and 1830s, people were pushed into the forested areas to search for the land that is suitable for farming since lots of the Tasmania’s grasslands and open woodlands were taken up for pastoral development. </li>
            <li>In the late 1850s, under the Waste Land Acts, more forested area are available for settlement.</li>
            <li>In the summer of 1850-51, northern Tasmania experienced a major bushfire catastrophe (known as the Black Thursday).</li>
            <li>A number of bushfires were reported during the hot dry summer of 1853 </li>
            <h3>It suggests that the vale of Belvoir area was tortured by a series of fires around 1850s and may undergo different scales of fires after that.</h3>

            <h2>Dendro</h2>
            <img src="img/dendro.png">
            <h5>Results of the dendrochronology of the Vale of Belvoir. Data from each site is located on the left, while all data are presented on the right.</h5>
            <li>In the southern hemisphere, the northern side of a mountain receives more sunlight since the slope is facing toward the sun while the southern side often have more shades (Barbour et al. 1999). At the hottest time of the day in the afternoon, the sun will be in the west, that is the reason why the west-facing slope is often warmer than the east-facing slope and it often cause a dry westly wind. Since both site 1 and site 3 are northwest facing slope and site 2 is a southeast- facing slope, site 1 and site 3 are hotter and drier than site 2, which means the site 1 and site 3 have higher flammability.</li>
            <li>High-intensity fires often lead to create even-aged stands (Simkin & Baker 2008). Those fires may also cause a dynamic forest boundary since the remnants of these forests have a high tendency to recolonize in an adjacent area. Site 1 and site 3 both are even-aged cohorts with most of the trees are less than 160 years old. We assumed they both have a dynamic boundary over the last 160 years and may suffer a fire catastrophe around 1850s. Since four trees in site 1 are older than 160 years, we suggest that some of the trees survived the major fire event. It indicates the fire is less intense in site 1 than in site 3.</li>
            <li>Associated with less intense fires, the forest tend to be generated into a multi-aged stands with a stable forest boundary since more trees could survive the moderate fire and regenerate relatively easy (Simkin & Baker 2008). Because of the moist environment, we can say that the site 2 suffered less intense fire than site 1 and site 3. During the fire catastrophe, more trees at site 2 survived and made site 2 a multi-aged cohort with a phase between 1850s and 1860s. It shows that the site 2 might have a stable forest boundary over time and that phase is likely to state the regeneration of the trees.</li>

            <h2>Nutrients</h2>

            <h5>Results of the Carbon and Nitrogen analysis of the Vale of Belvoir.</h5>
            <h3>According to the Jackson Alternative Stable States (Wood & Bowman 2011), lower flammability leads to less frequent fires and it causes the accumulation in soil nutrients. </h3>
            <li>The damp environment and the low flammability at site 2 might be one reasonable explanation for containing a massive amount of nutrients.</li>
            <li>Taking a broad view of the whole vale data, there is no distinct difference of Carbon and Nitrogen content between grassland and forest. Therefore, the soil nutrient is probability not a determinant factor for the grassland-forest distribution and it is not capable to tell the fluctuation of the forest-grassland boundary.</li>

            <h2>Charcol</h2>
            <img src="img/charcol.png">
            <h5>Pollen and charcoal data from the Vale of Belvoir split in to sites facing southeast and sites facing northwest.</h5>
            <li>Many coals have a large amount of charcoal throughout a period of time when the air contains more oxygen. It can make the vegetation become more moist and easier to flame. Burying more decay-resistant charcoal and organic matters during a multi fire period may increased the content of oxygen and reduce the carbon dioxide levels (Bowman et al. 2009). As a consequence, it could provide support to make the vegetation more flammable as the Earth storing more charcoal. The changes of the dominant species in grassland and forest imply an oscillation in certain area. With particular reference to the variable part of the pollen and charcoal data at the northwest facing slope (as known as site 1 and site 3) in figure 4, they have larger fluctuations than the data at the Southeast facing slope (as site 2). It suggests that the vegetation type in site 1 and site 3 changes more frequently than site 2, so the forest-grassland boundary at site 1 and site 3 might be dynamic over times and the boundary at site 2 might be relatively stable.</li>
